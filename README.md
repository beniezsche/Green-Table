# Green Table [WIP]

Green Table is a rendition of VisiCalc written in C. The idea is to build a limited - feature version of VisiCalc to understand how a spreadsheet functions.

To run the application on your terminal:

```
gcc main.c -o main -lncurses
```

There will a main.out file created in the same folder. To run it:

```
./main
```
