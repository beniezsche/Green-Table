# Green Table [WIP]

Green Table is a rendition of VisiCalc written in C. The idea is to build a limited - feature version of VisiCalc to understand how a spreadsheet functions.

## Features planned

1. Functions (SUM and AVG)
2. Format Cell (left or right)
3. Replicate value (relative)

## Usage

To run the application on your terminal:

```
gcc main.c -o main.out -lncurses
```

There will a main.out file created in the same folder. To run it:

```
./main.out
```
